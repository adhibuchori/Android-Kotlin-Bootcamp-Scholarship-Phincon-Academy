## Project Brief
Personal Finance Manager is a program designed to assist users in managing their personal finances, consisting of three main features: recording income and expenses, calculating the final balance, and displaying transaction history.

## Main Feature
1. **Recording Income**: Users can record the amount of money received as income. Each income entry is stored with details that can be viewed in the transaction history.
2. **Recording Expenses**: Users can record the amount of money spent as expenses. Each expense entry is stored with details that can be viewed in the transaction history.
3. **Calculating Final Balance**: The application automatically calculates the final balance based on the total income and expenses recorded. The final balance is updated whenever a new income or expense is added.
4. **Displaying Transaction History**: The application stores and displays a transaction history of both income and expenses that have been recorded. The transaction history can be accessed anytime to view details of income and expenses.

## Tech Implementation
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Utilizes OOP concepts with classes and objects such as FinancialManager and Transaction.
2. **Collections Framework**: Uses mutableListOf to store Transaction objects in transactions.
3. **Input/Output (I/O)**: Uses java.util.Scanner to receive user input via the console.
4. **Control Flow**: Uses the when control flow structure to handle user menu choices.
5. **Data Classes**: Uses the Transaction data class to represent transactions with properties type and amount.
6. **Looping**: Utilizes a while (true) loop to run the program and a forEachIndexed loop to print transaction history.
7. **Basic Mathematical Operations**: Performs addition and subtraction operations on balance based on transaction types.
